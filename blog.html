                    <p> If you choose to get a bikini wax in Miami’s hot weather, you probably have an idea of what to
                        expect during the process. But what about wax aftercare? While most of us know how to prepare,
                        no
                        one really talks about how to ease any lingering discomfort or extend the life of your freshly
                        waxed
                        bikini. We went out to experts at Wax Spa for their best post-wax care tips, and what not to do

                                    “Prior to waxing, the length of your hair should be at least a quarter inch long,”
                                    says

                                    Spa. Any less and the wax won’t have enough hair to grip during the removal process.

                                    Avoid scheduling your wax around the time of your period, when skin can be more

                                    (It’s also a general courtesy to your waxer, as well, to avoid booking around that
                                    time

                                <p>Make sure you’re clean.
                                    Yes, it’s a kindness to your waxer that you arrive fresh and cleansed (and not right

                    <p>Besides reminding yourself that no one is judging your vulva (seriously), the most important
                        bikini wax advice pros want to reiterate is that you should come to your appointment prepared.
                        Below are the highlights, but be sure to read our guide that answers the question you’ve
                        probably wondered at least once in your life: What is a Brazilian wax from Miami’s Award Winning
                        Wax Spa like?</p>

                        <li>
                            <p> Know what you want.
                                Believe it or not, there’s more to a wax than slapping on warm goop and ripping it off.
                                There are actually many different styles or types of waxes you can get during the
                                hair-removal process at Wax Spa. You can get just the sides cleaned up (a bikini line
                                wax),
                                you can get everything from pubic area and from the labia but a small strip of hair or a
                                triangle is left at front (a Brazilian wax), or you can get all the hair removed from
                                the
                                labia and from the front of the bikini area (Playboy bikini wax). If you’re not sure
                                which
                                you want to start with, don’t be afraid to ask your technician. It’s only awkward for
                                them
                                if you don’t like the end result.</p>

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p> Don’t be surprised if your waxer asks for help.
                                If you’ve never gotten a wax before, a few things about the process might strike you as
                                surprising. The biggest being that your technician may ask you to help hold your skin in
                                certain places—or, yes, your cheeks—so they’re able to get every last inch of hair. It’s
                                really not as uncomfortable as it might sound, but it is certainly intimate. And don’t
                                forget, the help goes both ways. Don’t hesitate to ask your waxer for a cooling gel to
                                put
                                on immediately afterward to soothe inflammation, especially if you have sensitive skin.

                    <p>Once you’ve made it through the tough part, it’s all about taking extra care and caution for the
                        next
                        48 hours. Here are the 8 things Wax Spa experts recommend avoiding while your newly waxed skin
                        is at
                        its most sensitive. After that, you should be smooth sailing for the next three to four weeks,
                        when
                        hair typically begins to grow back after a wax.</p>

                    <ol class="mxybc-5">
                        <li>

                            <p>Stay out of the sun.
                                The first 48 hours after waxing, your already delicate skin down there is even more
                                vulnerable.
                                So while you may be dying to throw on your bikini the second you leave the Wax Spa, keep
                                in
                                mind
                                that sensitive skin is more susceptible to U.V. rays.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p>Avoid swimming.
                                This kind of goes hand in hand with the above, but it goes for indoor pools too—and
                                especially
                                large bodies of water (like an ocean, lake, or river) that could contain bacteria. If
                                you
                                don’t,
                                you could have an increased risk of getting an infection, and no one wants that.</p>

                        <li>

                            <p>Be careful not to over exfoliate.
                                Waxing removes the topmost layer of dead skin, along with the hair, so any kind of
                                additional
                                scrubbing can lead to skin damage. However, after the first few days, it’s important to
                                remove
                                dead skin cells with a light scrub or exfoliating serum to prevent ingrown hairs.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p> Be selective with your skin care.
                                Stick with gentle, fragrance-free body washes and creams for the first few days after
                                your
                                waxing appointment.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p> Take showers instead of baths for the first 48 hours.
                                Running water from the shower will be cleaner than sitting in bath water. Why? See
                                reason #2
                                again; it makes you more prone to infection.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p>Sorry, no hookups.
                                This one is a pretty standard rule most waxers will warn you about, but it’s easy to
                                forget.
                                Any
                                kind of action down there—sex in particular—can lead to discomfort. Consider turning the
                                first
                                two days into official cuddle time.</p>

                        <li>

                            <p>Opt for loose clothing.
                                One thing to keep in mind both before you head into your appointment and after: Anything
                                tight-fitting can rub raw spots and irritate. You’ll want to give your leggings a break
                                for
                                a
                                few days and stick with maxi dresses, flowy pants, and breathable cotton fabrics.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p>Avoid intense workouts.
                                Another reason to give leggings (and your body) a rest, activities such as running,
                                aerobics, or
                                cycling can cause friction in treated areas, and sweating can also be irritating. In
                                other
                                words, use this as an excuse to hit the couch for a couple of days. You deserve a break.

                    <p>Waxing is one of the most popular ways to get rid of body hair. It’s quick, convenient, and —
                        because the hair is pulled out from the root — the results last longer than shaving.</p>
                    <p>If you are new to waxing, you may be wondering what type of wax to use. There are two different
                        types: hard wax and soft wax.</p>
                    <p>Although both do a good job of removing hair from the follicle, hard wax is better for smaller,
                        more sensitive areas like your Bikini area, Underarms or Facial waxing. Soft wax, on the other
                        hand, is a better option for larger areas like your legs.</p>
                    <p>This article will highlight the differences between hard wax and soft wax, and also look at the
                        pros and cons of both in an effort to help you choose the right waxing method for your needs.

                        because hard wax adheres to the hairs rather than to the skin, which gives it an advantage in
                        the hair removal process.</p>

                    <p>Since hard wax only sticks to the hair, you can treat and retreat areas to make sure all of the
                        hairs are removed without damaging the skin,” explain waxing experts at Wax Spa.</p>

                    <p>Hard wax is thicker than soft wax and works by hardening on your skin — hence, the name. Once it
                        hardens, you can remove it with your hands, so there’s no need for waxing strips. This makes the
                        process a lot less painful.</p>

                    <p>According to experts at Wax Spa in Miami, hard wax is best suited for use on your Bikini,
                        Underarms, and Facial waxing.</p>

                    <p> Most people have some form of unwanted body hair. Body waxing is a long-lasting option for
                        individuals who want swim-season bodies without the irritation and inconvenience of daily
                        shaving. Unfortunately, many opt for home body waxing kits that are uncomfortable, tricky to use
                        properly, and that are also potentially dangerous if not used properly.</p>

                    <p>According to NBC News at WSMV-TV, a woman was burnt quite badly due to a home body waxing kit
                        that either malfunctioned or wasn’t used properly. The woman experienced second degree burns
                        after attempting to microwave the supposedly “micro-wave safe” kit she purchased. Although these
                        experiences are few and far between, many view waxing procedures like a brazilian bikini line as
                        a painful experience.</p>

                    <p>Those who want hair removal without the possibility of mishandling home-kits and intimidating
                        home hair removal options often opt for a spa experience. Spas that specialize in hair removal
                        through waxing offer services that are completed by professionals who are well trained and
                        highly experienced. Add in a relaxing setting, and quality spas that specialize in waxing can
                        actually make an experience enjoyable rather than painful.</p>
                    <p>Wax Spa in Miami offers no-pain body waxing in a variety of packages designed to remove hair
                        without the worry. Instead of fumbling around with a home waxing kit, individuals preparing for
                        the swim season or who tire of shaving consistently choose a spa approach to hair removal. The
                        quickness and efficiency of a professional waxing alleviates the fear of most individuals
                        looking for a wax.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-red text-uppercase">Body waxing and convenience</h2>
                    <p>With home waxing kits, missing a spot or two here or there is almost a certainty. Backs of legs,
                        the back, and other troublesome areas are difficult to reach at home. Professional body waxers,
                        however, are able to get rid of unwanted hair in one visit rather than in several attempts at
                        home. This saves not only pain, but time as well.</p>
                    <p>Time is really the top benefit of body waxing. Shaving requires buying blades, shaving areas, and
                        repeating it all over again in just a couple of days. When removing hair through a traditional
                        method like shaving, missing areas is again a likelihood. This can cause unseemly hair on areas
                        like the ankle and back. Going back to shave over areas again is a time consuming and
                        frustrating task.</p>
                    <p>Body Waxing is a convenient option for those who have a quality wax focused spa nearby. In order
                        to save time and avoid some pain, many individuals choose waxing services from a quality spa.

                                <p>It encourages lymph flow in the body. The lymph system is a slow-moving system of
                                    vessels and lymph nodes that are supplementary to the body’s system of blood
                                    circulation. The lymph system both delivers nutrients to the cells and carries away
                                    excess water, cellular waste, bacteria, viruses, and toxins.Lymphatic drainage works
                                    to improve the function of the lymphatic system, which helps to remove and filter
                                    waste, toxins and excess fluid from the body. Good lymphatic circulation in the body
                                    will prevent lymph fluid from solidifying and binding with the collagen fibers that
                                    are in the fat cells. The result? A detoxified body with less cellulite.</p>

                        upper dermal layers of the skin without the traditional needles or injections. Ideal for clients
                        that are frightened or uncomfortable with needles, this pain free treatment is less invasive and
                        fast, and allows clients to plump and fill their lips, fine lines and wrinkles. The pen uses
                        pressure which causes the Hyaluronic Acid to turn into Nanoscale molecules and inserts the
                        Hyaluronic Acid Filler through the skin. The diameter of this flow is 0.17 mm, twice as small as
                        the smallest insulin needle. The mixture used is Pure Hyaluronic Acid or Dermal Fillers such as
                        Juvederm.</p>
                    <p>The Hyaluron Pen can be used to create volume, shape and lift.</p>
                    <p>Treatment areas include: Lips, nasolabial lines, marionette lines, forehead wrinkles, etc.</p>
                    <p>Perfect for Lip augmentation and reducing wrinkles.</p>
                    <p>The Hyaluronic Acid only reaches the papillary layer of the dermis making this safe treatment
                        with no risk of occlusion as well as no sharp tips to puncture blood vessels.</p>

                        <p>A natural sugar found in the human body, hyaluronic acid is the most hydrating substance in
                            the world. It is function is to attract water and keep skin hydrated, plump and youthful. As
                            the human body creates Hyaluronic Acid naturally it is impossible to be allergic to it.</p>
                        <p>As we age, the body decreases the amount of Hyaluronic Acid and Collagen fibers. They dry up
                            and become thinner, resulting in loss of hydration and elasticity.</p>
                        <p>This causes skin to sag and wrinkles to form. By adding hyaluronic acid into the skin we
                            revive collagen and promote a fresher, plumper effect.</p>
                        <p>Hyaluronic Acid is the main structural element of connective tissue.</p>

                        <p>Hyaluron Pen is a new category as a procedure. Although being really simple, the device is
                            actually incredibly powerful. Why? Because you can do a great deal with this little tool –
                            it combines approaches that have so far being used in mesotherapy and fillers, plus it is
                            totally safe.</p>

                        <p>As one should know the technology was nothing new in the device itself. It has been used for
                            inserting insulin for years. However, now from the Spring of 2018 it is used to fill in
                            wrinkles and also inject hyaluronic acid mixture into the lips. It started steady growth in
                            smaller beauty aesthetic groups from then on. After larger introductions in the early in the
                            early autumn of 2018, it became widely more popular. The blow-out point was early winter
                            2018. Wax Spa were one of the first in South Florida to offer Hyaluronic treatments such as
                            Lip augmentation, Marionette lines and Smile lines reductions. For appointment please call

                        <p>First, let’s face the facts, getting a bikini wax hurts. However, they don’t have to hurt so
                            badly. There are several ways you can minimize the pain. If you’re new to waxing, make sure
                            to start out with a professional and we’re going to tell you exactly how to keep the pain at
                            bay.</p>

                                <h2 class="text-red text-md">Make Sure Your Hair is the Right Length</h2>
                                <p>If your hair is too short the wax will not be able to properly pull the hair from the follicle. You can always ask your esthetician to trim the hair first. If for some reason you don’t trim first it can make the process more painful. You’ll want to make sure the hair is about ¼ inch long before waxing.</p>

                                <h2 class="text-red text-md">Stop Shaving</h2>
                                <p>If it’s your first time going to get a bikini wax, you should stop shaving at least three weeks prior to your wax appointment. If you’re a veteran, you should already know better! Shaving can cause awful pain and itching and it will cause hair to grow back denser. Once you’ve started getting waxed you should go every four weeks, which will make the hair grow back thinner and will make future waxes less painful.</p>

                                <p>Exfoliating the week of your appointment will get rid of the layer of dead skin that’s probably trapping hairs. Removing dead and dry skin allows hair to come to the surface so it can be properly pulled from the root on the first try.</p>

                                <p>If you have some free time before your appointment you should soak in a warm bath for about 20 minutes. This will open up your pores and soften your hair, which will make waxing easier.                                </p>

                                <p>You should take an over-the-counter painkiller with a glass of water about an hour before your appointment. This way the medicine will already be in full effect by the time you get waxed. In addition to minimizing pain, it also has anti-inflammatory components.</p>

                                <p>Your pain threshold is at its lowest right before your period and you’re especially sensitive about five days before, through the end. Three to four days after your cycle is when your threshold is at its highest, so it’s best to book your appointments during these days.</p>

                                <p>A big no no right before getting waxed is trying to use ice to numb the area. This will only tighten and close up your pores, which will make waxing much more difficult. Instead, use a numbing cream about 30 minutes before your appointment to dull the pain.</p>
