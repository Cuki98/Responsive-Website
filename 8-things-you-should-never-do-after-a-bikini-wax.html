            <img class="image-sizing " src="assets/blog/8thing-you-should-never-do-after-a-bikini-wax.jpg" alt="">
            <p> If you choose to get a bikini wax in Miami’s hot weather, you probably have an idea of what to
                expect during the process. But what about wax aftercare? While most of us know how to prepare,
                no
                one really talks about how to ease any lingering discomfort or extend the life of your freshly
                waxed
                bikini. We went out to experts at Wax Spa for their best post-wax care tips, and what not to do
                the
                first two days following your appointment. Here’s their top advice for preventing ingrown hairs
                and
                taking care of your newly waxed skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mxybc-5">

            <h2 class="text-red text-uppercase">Prewax care</h1>
                <p>Whether you’re waxing your legs or arms at home or booking a professional bikini wax at Wax
                    Spa,
                    the pre-wax care is relatively the same—and simple. Here’s a quick breakdown of what pros
                    say
                    you should prepare for ahead of time.</p>

                <ol class="mxybc-5 list-style-numbered">
                    <li>

                        <p>Make sure your hair is long enough.
                            “Prior to waxing, the length of your hair should be at least a quarter inch long,”
                            says
                            Wax
                            Spa. Any less and the wax won’t have enough hair to grip during the removal process.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <p>Reduce pain by planning ahead.
                            Avoid scheduling your wax around the time of your period, when skin can be more
                            sensitive.
                            (It’s also a general courtesy to your waxer, as well, to avoid booking around that
                            time
                            of
                            the month.) Wax Spa also recommends avoiding alcohol before your appointment—it will
                            only
                            make your blood thinner and more sensitive to pain, and taking a painkiller half an
                            hour
                            before to help ease any discomfort.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li>

                        <p>Make sure you’re clean.
                            Yes, it’s a kindness to your waxer that you arrive fresh and cleansed (and not right
                            off
                            a
                            Spin bike), but it will also help your wax go more smoothly. Natural oils, sweat, or
                            body
                            lotions can prohibit wax from adhering as well.</p>

            <h2 class="text-red text-uppercase">During your waxing appointment</h2>

            <p>Besides reminding yourself that no one is judging your vulva (seriously), the most important
                bikini wax advice pros want to reiterate is that you should come to your appointment prepared.
                Below are the highlights, but be sure to read our guide that answers the question you’ve
                probably wondered at least once in your life: What is a Brazilian wax from Miami’s Award Winning
                Wax Spa like?</p>
            <ol class="mxybc-5">
                <li>
                    <p> Know what you want.
                        Believe it or not, there’s more to a wax than slapping on warm goop and ripping it off.
                        There are actually many different styles or types of waxes you can get during the
                        hair-removal process at Wax Spa. You can get just the sides cleaned up (a bikini line
                        wax),
                        you can get everything from pubic area and from the labia but a small strip of hair or a
                        triangle is left at front (a Brazilian wax), or you can get all the hair removed from
                        the
                        labia and from the front of the bikini area (Playboy bikini wax). If you’re not sure
                        which
                        you want to start with, don’t be afraid to ask your technician. It’s only awkward for
                        them
                        if you don’t like the end result.</p>

                </li>

                <li>

                    <p> Don’t be surprised if your waxer asks for help.
                        If you’ve never gotten a wax before, a few things about the process might strike you as
                        surprising. The biggest being that your technician may ask you to help hold your skin in
                        certain places—or, yes, your cheeks—so they’re able to get every last inch of hair. It’s
                        really not as uncomfortable as it might sound, but it is certainly intimate. And don’t
                        forget, the help goes both ways. Don’t hesitate to ask your waxer for a cooling gel to
                        put
                        on immediately afterward to soothe inflammation, especially if you have sensitive skin.

        <div class="container mxybc-5">
            <h2 class="text-red text-uppercase">Waxing aftercare</h2>
            <p>Once you’ve made it through the tough part, it’s all about taking extra care and caution for the
                next
                48 hours. Here are the 8 things Wax Spa experts recommend avoiding while your newly waxed skin
                is at
                its most sensitive. After that, you should be smooth sailing for the next three to four weeks,
                when
                hair typically begins to grow back after a wax.</p>

            <ol class="mxybc-5">
                <li>

                    <p>Stay out of the sun.
                        The first 48 hours after waxing, your already delicate skin down there is even more
                        vulnerable.
                        So while you may be dying to throw on your bikini the second you leave the Wax Spa, keep
                        in
                        mind
                        that sensitive skin is more susceptible to U.V. rays.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p>Avoid swimming.
                        This kind of goes hand in hand with the above, but it goes for indoor pools too—and
                        especially
                        large bodies of water (like an ocean, lake, or river) that could contain bacteria. If
                        you
                        don’t,
                        you could have an increased risk of getting an infection, and no one wants that.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p>Be careful not to over exfoliate.
                        Waxing removes the topmost layer of dead skin, along with the hair, so any kind of
                        additional
                        scrubbing can lead to skin damage. However, after the first few days, it’s important to
                        remove
                        dead skin cells with a light scrub or exfoliating serum to prevent ingrown hairs.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p> Be selective with your skin care.
                        Stick with gentle, fragrance-free body washes and creams for the first few days after
                        your
                        waxing appointment.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p> Take showers instead of baths for the first 48 hours.
                        Running water from the shower will be cleaner than sitting in bath water. Why? See
                        reason #2
                        again; it makes you more prone to infection.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p>Sorry, no hookups.
                        This one is a pretty standard rule most waxers will warn you about, but it’s easy to
                        forget.
                        Any
                        kind of action down there—sex in particular—can lead to discomfort. Consider turning the
                        first
                        two days into official cuddle time.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p>Opt for loose clothing.
                        One thing to keep in mind both before you head into your appointment and after: Anything
                        tight-fitting can rub raw spots and irritate. You’ll want to give your leggings a break
                        for
                        a
                        few days and stick with maxi dresses, flowy pants, and breathable cotton fabrics.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <p>Avoid intense workouts.
                        Another reason to give leggings (and your body) a rest, activities such as running,
                        aerobics, or
                        cycling can cause friction in treated areas, and sweating can also be irritating. In
                        other
                        words, use this as an excuse to hit the couch for a couple of days. You deserve a break.
