                            than shaving every day,

                        <p class="font-poppins text-sm">The wax can be used on almost any part of the body as needed.
                            Most frequently waxed areas for women are legs, underarms, bikini (Brazilian or Playboy
                            bikini), eyebrows and face (facial waxing). For men: chest, legs, arms, underarms and back.
                            The exceptions for waxing are the beards and inside the ears.</p>

                        <p class="font-poppins text-sm">Absolutely not. It might seem so because you will be accustomed
                            to a hairless zone and new hair will be intolerable. Usually, regrowth will be finer,
                            thinner and slower. Eventually, hair growth may stop altogether.</p>

                        <p class="font-poppins text-sm">This is one of the more prevalent questions, and the truth is
                            that it really depends on the waxologist and the quality of the wax. An unskilled waxologist
                            using a lower quality wax could lead to a painful experience, but our highly-skilled
                            professionals at Wax Spa use only state-of-the art natural wax imported from Europe.</p>

                        <p class="font-poppins text-sm">Never. Never. Never. A very good question that you should ask
                            any waxing salon you may frequent or better yet check if there are two separate trashcans in
                            the wax room; one for the wax and the other one for table paper, disposable spatulas,
                            gloves, etc. Hard wax is the only kind of wax that certain salons re-use. Hard wax is
                            usually yellow or green in color and does not require the use of strips. Because hard wax
                            must be applied in a thick layer, certain salons re-use it to save money. They melt the wax,
                            strain out the hair, let the wax harden again and then melt it for re-use.</p>

                            including shaving, creams and laser procedures. The benefits over shaving are fairly
                            obvious: no more propping up appendages in uncomfortable positions, unsightly marks and the
                            results last for weeks! Creams only remove hair at the surface and not the root, leading to
                            visibility after only a few days. Laser procedures are quite costly, and you can expect to
                            spend anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars!</p>

                        <p class="font-poppins text-sm">The typical result lasts anywhere from two to four weeks.
                            However, an additional benefit of repeat waxing is that it actually stunts hair growth!
                            Continual waxing damages the hair follicle, thereby curtailing hair growth over time.</p>

                        <p class="font-poppins text-sm">Shorter hair makes it difficult for the wax to grab, so the hair
                            needs to be 1/8 to 1/4 inch in length (about 10 to 14 days of growth). Please note this
                            especially applies to first-time clients who have been shaving. The worst possible thing you
                            could do to your bikini is to wax too soon after shaving. Stubble is awful to take up if it
                            is too short, and this is why we ask for the appropriate amount of time for regrowth.</p>

                            help lessen the discomfort. One is to avoid caffeine. Caffeine is a skin stimulant. It gets
                            your nerves up and dancing and ready to feel everything. Some people also find taking Advil
                            or Motrin a half hour before their appointment is quite useful. You should also avoid
                            swimming or prolonged sun exposure the day before your appointment, as these activities can
                            heighten skin sensitivity. Come to your appointment relaxed. Being anxious about the
                            Brazilian Bikini Wax can definitely contribute to it being more painful.</p>

                            clothing options as well and try to avoid very tight clothing to your wax appointment, or 24
                            hours after a bikini wax. You should also avoid excessive sun exposure the day after your
                            appointment, but if you must bask in Miami’s bountiful rays use sun block with high SPF.</p>
